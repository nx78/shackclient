NEWS:
  This November 5th version adds over 200
  more camos to the package, very nearly
  completing the Inner Sphere side of all
  canonical camo/paint schemes. The only
  ones left are units I can't find any
  listing of colors for (ie new FCCW units
  built off mixed commands and the armed
  forces of the Outworlds Alliance). Plenty
  of old schemes have been reworked to be
  more accurate, and many, many new ones
  were added, including Solaris and MWDA
  schemes.

INSTALLATION:
  Simply extract these files into your
  camo directory. Please don't use any
  sub-directories for organization. I
  have found that if people do this it
  is unlikely that you will be able to
  see the camos on both ends of an MM
  game. I have given them [tags] for easy
  identification.

CAMO LIST:
  Someone asked me to make a list of all
  the camos. If I was paid to do this, I
  might, but since that'd be entering some
  400-plus camo names, sorry. :) Maybe next
  time!

AND ETC:
  All of these camos were done by myself
  with many references taken from that tip
  top site CamoSpecs. Feel free to do with
  these what you will! Enjoy!
